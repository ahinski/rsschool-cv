## Summary
 I'm 18 years old, currently 2nd year BSUIR student. My main goal for this course is to try my
 best to complete this course and gain some new expirience in web-development to work in this sphere in the future. 
 I think it's rather important to be a part of courses like this, especially in the start of your career, 
 to cooperate with students like you, with experienced mentors and to challenge yourself.
 And it's pretty cool that everybody have an opportunity to study in "Rolling Scopes".

code();
```
